Welcome to `Lib-I18n` with the new release `0.7.1`.

The library `Lib-I18N` allows a developer to bind a key-value pair of a`.properties` 
file to a [StringBinding]. This makes it very easy to change the language during 
runtime in a [JavaFX] application.  
Lib-I18N is written in JavaFX, [Maven] and [NetBeans].
