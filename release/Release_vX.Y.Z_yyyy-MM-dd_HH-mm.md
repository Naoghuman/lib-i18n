Welcome to `Lib-I18n` with the new release `x.y.z`.

The library `Lib-I18N` allowed the developer to bind a `.properties` pair (key / value) 
to a [StringBinding]. This means that changing the language during runtime in a 
[JavaFX] application is no longer a problem.  
Lib-I18N is written in JavaFX, [Maven] and [NetBeans].
