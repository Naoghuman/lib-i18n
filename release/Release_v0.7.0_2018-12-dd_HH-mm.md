Welcome to `Lib-I18n` with the new release `0.7.0`.

The library `Lib-I18N` allowed the developer to bind easly `.properties` key (values) 
to a [StringBinding]. So changing the language during runtime in a [JavaFX] application 
won't be a problem anymore.  
Lib-I18N is written in JavaFX, [Maven] and [NetBeans].
